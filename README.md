# CIS550-Project

## Milestone 4 tasks
Each member needs to
1. backend: finish their parts of code in the index.js and route.js in the **comics -> server** folder
2. frontend: create .js files for the assigned features in the **comics -> client -> src -> component** folder
3. frontend: create .css files for each feature page using basic settings in the **comics -> client -> src -> style** folder

Note:
the comics -> db-config.js file has been updated with our new configs, haven't tested whether it works tho
